## Current Implementation Status

### Strapi + Astro Integration
We've successfully integrated Strapi as a headless CMS with the AstroWind template. Key components:

1. **API Configuration**
- Strapi backend running at localhost:1337
- API token authentication set up in Strapi admin
- Environment variables configured for API communication

2. **Content Structure**
- Timeline Entry content type created in Strapi
- Data structure follows Strapi's convention with capitalized field names (e.g., Title, Date, Description)
- API endpoints follow pattern: `/api/[content-type]` (e.g., `/api/timeline-entries`)

3. **Frontend Integration**
- Utility function (`fetchAPI`) created to handle Strapi API calls
- TypeScript interfaces matching Strapi's response structure
- Test component demonstrating successful data fetching and display

### Key Learnings
1. **Strapi Data Structure**
   - Field names in Strapi are case-sensitive and reflect in the API response
   - Data comes wrapped in a structure: `{ data: [], meta: { pagination: {} } }`
   - API tokens needed for authentication

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Need to define interfaces matching Strapi's exact response structure
   - Error handling needs to account for Strapi's response format

3. **Environment Management**
   - API URLs and tokens managed through environment variables
   - Separate configurations needed for development and production
